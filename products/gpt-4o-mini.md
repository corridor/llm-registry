GPT-4o mini (“o” for “omni”) is a fast, affordable small model for focused tasks. It accepts both text and image inputs, and produces text outputs (including Structured Outputs). It is ideal for fine-tuning, and model outputs from a larger model like GPT-4o can be distilled to GPT-4o-mini to produce similar results at lower cost and latency.
